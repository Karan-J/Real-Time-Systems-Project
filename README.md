# Real-Time-Systems-Project


## Description

Implementation of a real-time image processing application in a popular real-time Operating System LitmusRT. The image processing application is developed in Python using OpenCV and is invoked from the C code of LitmusRT. The images(test data) for the task are generated by capturing screenshots from the input videos and storing them. This utility is also developed using OpenCV. The image processing tasks performed on an image are: 

1. Converting original image to its Black & White version
2. Converting original image to its Blurred version
3. Converting original image to its Brightened version
4. Converting original image to its Darkened version
5. Converting original image to its Grayscaled version
6. Converting original image to its Negative version
7. Converting original image to its Rotated version
8. Converting original image to its Sepia version

After the implementation of this image processing application, its performance is analyzed under the different schedulers provided by LitmusRT. Based on the analysis, a scheduler best suited for a particular type of task is recommended.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* A Linux-based System patched with a LitmusRT kernel

```
python3.9 src/v2s.py 
```
* To run and test the image-processing module
```
python3.9 /home/kj/litmus/mytools/src/main.py --input_folder ./imgs0/
```
* To compile and run the C module
```
